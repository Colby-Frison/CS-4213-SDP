B. Can showcase specific objects and types as they move between activities.
C. Helps to refine high-level requirements and use cases. 
D. Allows for forking and joining to express complex relationships. 

 

2. Which of the following is one of the two consistency rules for the decomposition of a process in activity modeling?

B. Transformational systems must always be stateless.
C. Working software must be valued over documentation.
D. Don't make the activity diagram too complex.
