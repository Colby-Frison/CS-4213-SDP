1) Which is NOT a benefit of using design patterns?

a) Patterns can accurately describe entire systems, reducing the complexity of communication.

b) Patterns improve communication because the pattern names effectively convey design problems and solutions.

c) Many patterns implement software design principles, thus improving the quality of software systems.

d) Patterns effectively support agile development because they reduce design, implementation, testing, and change efforts.

Group F:

1) Which of these is NOT a guideline for applying the Controller Pattern?

A. Look for the information expert in the current sequence diagram, then in the design class diagram, and finally in the domain model.

B. Avoid overloading a controller.

C. Apply use case controller unless there are only a few actor requests and the system will not expand in the future.

D. Properly assign the responsibilities to process a use case to the controller, the business objects, and other resource management objects.

Group C

1) Which of the following best explains why the Singleton pattern is useful in software design?
A) It ensures that only one instance of a class exists and provides a global access point to it.
B) It allows unlimited instances of a class to be created whenever needed.
C) It enforces that every object must inherit from a common superclass.
D) It guarantees low-latency content delivery in distributed systems.

2) When applied correctly, how do design patterns primarily support teamwork in large software projects?
A) By creating a shared vocabulary that helps developers communicate design solutions clearly.
B) By automatically generating UML diagrams for every subsystem.
C) By removing the need for code reviews, since patterns prevent all defects.
D) By ensuring every team member must use the same programming language.
