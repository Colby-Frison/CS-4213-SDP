1) What does a state diagram do?

a) It models state-dependent behavior of an object.
b) It models time-ordered interaction behavior between objects.
c) It specifies constraints to support engineering analysis. 
d) It models interconnection and interfacing of internal elements of a block. 

 

2) Which of the following is NOT a goal of the system decomposition phase?

a) The result should have as many subsystems as possible
b) The result should facilitate the use of commercial off-the-shelf parts
c) The subsystems should be easy to integrate
d) The result should enable separate engineering teams to develop the subsystems

Group D

1) What is the primary purpose of decomposing a system into a hierarchy of sub-systems during system architectural design?


A. To reduce complexity and cost by making sub-systems easier to design and implement
B. To ensure one engineer can handle all the engineering disciplines
C. To eliminate the need for system integration and testing
D. To meet the product deadline


2) If a subsystem is found to have a more performant solution under a different subsystem, which of the following is NOT part of the process to pivot that subsystem's responsibilities to another?

A. Redesign the system to circumnavigate the necessity for change of subsystem responsibility
B. Have an Interdisciplinary assessment of the proposed changes
C. Submit the proposed changes to the control board reviewer for approval
D. Adopt approved changes to increase performance and create an optimal division of responsibilities

Group J 

Q1) Which of the following best describes primary characteristics of system engineering? 

a) It emphasizes a top-down, divide-and-conquer process covering the entire system life cycle. 
b) It focuses only on software design and excludes hardware or human subsystems.
c) It limits system development to one engineering discipline at a time.
d) It is applied only during the testing and deployment phases.

Q2) When gathering system requirements, what is the main focus?

a) Learning about business goals, the current situation, and what users need. 
b) Writing down the internal code structure of the software.
c) Listing hardware requirements before anything else.
d) Jumping into implementation details before knowing the business needs.

1.Which is not a primary goal of system decomposition in system architectural design?

A) To enable separate engineering teams to develop subsystems independently
B) To facilitate the use of commercial off-the-shelf parts
C) To ensure subsystems are highly dependent on each other for flexibility
D) To make subsystems easy to integrate through simple interfaces

2. Which is not a benefit of using an object-oriented design diagram?

A) It makes it easier for new members to understand a large and complex system
B) It allows the software engineers to see objects as black boxes
C) It allows other engineering teams to communicate with software engineers
D) It dictates the software implementation
