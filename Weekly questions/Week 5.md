    What is NOT a benefit of domain modeling?

        It helps an object assume different forms.
        It serves as a common basis for subsequent design, implementation, testing, and maintenance.
        It helps the team establish a common understanding about an application and its domain. 
        It helps the team improve communication with customer and users.

    What is NOT a tool support for domain modeling?

Group C

1. What is the main focus of Object State Modeling compared to Object Interation Modeling?

A. OSM models intra-object state-dependent behavior, while OIM models inter-object behavior through time-ordered messages.

B. OSM models how objects communicate via messages, while OIM tracks internal states
C. OSM eliminates the need for UML diagrams, while OIM requires them.

D. OSM models transformational systems, while OIM models rule-based systems.

2. Which of the following best captures the purpose of Object State Modeling?
A. To identify, analyze, and design the state-dependent reactions of objects to external stimuli.

B. To generate detailed database schemas for persistent objects.

C. To ensure that use cases fully capure all actor-system interactions.

D. To guarantee that every system design satisfies the state pattern by default.
