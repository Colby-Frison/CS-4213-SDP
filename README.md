# CS 4213 - Software Design Patterns (SDP)

Fall 2025

## Course Description

CS 4213 - Software Design Patterns is a course focused on understanding and applying design patterns in software engineering. The course covers both GRASP (General Responsibility Assignment Software Patterns) principles and GoF (Gang of Four) design patterns, including creational, structural, and behavioral patterns.

Students learn to:
- Apply design patterns to solve common software design problems
- Understand system engineering principles and decomposition
- Model software systems using UML and SysML diagrams
- Implement patterns in various programming languages (C#, Java, JavaScript)
- Analyze and compare different design patterns
- Apply patterns to real-world systems and refactoring scenarios

## Course Structure

This repository is organized into the following directories:

- **Assignments/**: Individual and group assignments covering various design patterns
- **Class resources/**: Lecture slides and textbook materials
- **Notes/**: Class notes and study guides
- **Points/**: Participation points tracking
- **Weekly questions/**: Weekly question sets and answers

## Key Topics Covered

- System Engineering and Decomposition
- GRASP Patterns (Information Expert, Controller, etc.)
- GoF Creational Patterns (Singleton, Prototype, etc.)
- GoF Structural Patterns (Composite, Adapter, Facade, etc.)
- GoF Behavioral Patterns (State, Command, Interpreter, Mediator, etc.)
- Object State Modeling
- Responsibility Assignment Patterns
- Design pattern comparisons and trade-offs
