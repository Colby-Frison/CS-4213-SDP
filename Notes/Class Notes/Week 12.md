## M10S1-Applying the Bridge Pattern to the Daily Operations Dashboard

**Objectives:**

Apply the Bridge pattern to real dashboard scenarios to separate _abstraction_ from _implementation_ and analyze design trade-offs through peer review.

**Activity Instructions:**

- **Group Task-Activity 1: Design Pattern Phase (15 min)**  
    - Review the Bridge pattern from the textbook.
    - Select one of the following two use cases based on your group:
        - **Use Case 1 (A, B,C,D,E)**: Generating Reports (Performance, Task, or Feedback Reports) 
        - **Use Case 2 (F, G, H, I, J)**: Saving Project Data through Multiple Channels (Database, Cloud API, or File)
    - Design your solution using the Bridge pattern.
        
        - Identify the Abstraction, Implementor Interface, and Concrete Implementors.
            
        - Show the message flow between abstraction and implementor using a **UML** **Sequence Diagram**.
            
    - Screenshot your finished artifact and post it as a reply in this Discussion, **including your Group ID**.

- **Group Task-Activity 2: Peer Review Phase (15 min)**
    - Each group will review another group’s artifact as follows**:**  
        - **A ↔ J**
        - **B ↔ I**
        - **C ↔ H**
        - **D ↔ G**
        - **E ↔ F**
    - Under your reviewee’s post, write a short critique (max 150 words) addressing:
        - Does the design correctly apply the Bridge pattern?
        - How effectively does it decouple abstraction from implementation?
        - What improvement would make it more scalable or maintainable?
        - Be specific and constructive in your feedback.
- **Individual Task- Activity 3: Voting (10 min)**
    - After all reviews are posted:
    - READ all reviews and vote for the most effective and elegant reviewer group.
    - The winning reviewer group earns +1 extra credit for clarity and insight
