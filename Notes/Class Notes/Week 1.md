Can read previous stuff for reference, but not necessary

Wednesday:
Half of the group will present an open source project 

Friday:
Other half of the groups will present the design of the aforementioned projects.

==Software engineering is part of System engineering==

What is a systems engineer?
- A system engineer abstracting a problem in such a way to create a systemic approach to finding the solution

**Do systems die?**
- Kind of a philosophical question, as some believe that systems die, but other believe that the continuation of it generation keep it alive, so the system doesn't die.
- For example, a human is a system, and humans die, but the continuation of humans through generations means the system does not die, so the system would only die at extinction. But even then, there are other systems that branched off of humans so the system remain alive in them.
    - Like dinosaurs are extinct, but they evolved into all current life forms so in a way the system is still alive. So the system would only die if life itself seized to exists

- What is Gemba (from Toyota)
	- In the context of Toyota, Gemba (「現場」) is ==a Japanese term meaning "the real place" or "the actual place where work is done," referring to the factory floor or any other location where value is created==. Toyota leaders perform Gemba Walks, structured walkthroughs of the Gemba, to directly observe processes, understand the reality of the work, build relationships with employees, and identify opportunities for continuous improvement (Kaizen). This practice, developed by [Taiichi Ohno](https://www.google.com/search?client=firefox-b-1-d&sca_esv=65ee6f8ee085b56e&sxsrf=AE3TifOVbPLjhy3-zPrhkd4Oc9EkwYBnug%3A1756476458469&q=Taiichi+Ohno&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwiG8PPamLCPAxVPmmoFHYxYEh4QxccNegQIMRAB&mstk=AUtExfDx_JpTn-49xQEWNV-_qP473ExCRymfqHwFriucOqGl7kLzUjPXmI8w-A7JWLJ-PlPBclfGxZ2nw2xejPrn9XZ3KNKZeBg1MDl5NNXAWVSb3AARcvD6UEUvK-NaeZUdGByfCTKfPNQ77HwAk6P5nzHdLDflJrMJWcVT5gci9657p6CFlwW9rEI_W2sgXRt4lCjIeV_GOWrMfa9ua47JLXZxpbChKvE6oui7xDh7ftXqvSvMiVp8iMdf0TDjxjFMPdlvwLEptoesT_rh14jB8M5p&csui=3), is a core principle of the [Toyota Production System](https://www.google.com/search?client=firefox-b-1-d&sca_esv=65ee6f8ee085b56e&sxsrf=AE3TifOVbPLjhy3-zPrhkd4Oc9EkwYBnug%3A1756476458469&q=Toyota+Production+System&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwiG8PPamLCPAxVPmmoFHYxYEh4QxccNegQIMRAC&mstk=AUtExfDx_JpTn-49xQEWNV-_qP473ExCRymfqHwFriucOqGl7kLzUjPXmI8w-A7JWLJ-PlPBclfGxZ2nw2xejPrn9XZ3KNKZeBg1MDl5NNXAWVSb3AARcvD6UEUvK-NaeZUdGByfCTKfPNQ77HwAk6P5nzHdLDflJrMJWcVT5gci9657p6CFlwW9rEI_W2sgXRt4lCjIeV_GOWrMfa9ua47JLXZxpbChKvE6oui7xDh7ftXqvSvMiVp8iMdf0TDjxjFMPdlvwLEptoesT_rh14jB8M5p&csui=3) for uncovering inefficiencies and fostering a culture of ongoing improvement
	- In our context this term means to truly understand the system, allowing for proper Maintenance' and development

Why is drawing of the system worse then a flowchart diagram?
- It is more readable to everyone else
	- You will not have to explain it to other they can simply look at it and instantly understand everything about the system, with a picture of it, it will likely not make sense

### What is a requirement?
Functions of the system that are **required** to satisfy the *stakeholder*
- The stakeholder is key as they are the ones that will rely on the system

As a Software engineer our key requirement is to **identify the stakeholders**

### What is decomposition?
Decomposition is breaking down the main system into subsystem in order to meet all requirements while making the subsystems as simple as possible and ideally as independent as possible from other subsystems.

### Why do we draw?
To visualize the thing, and while drawing we realize the empty gaps in our vision, allowing us to fill in gaps.
Makes it easier to communicate ideas in simpler more universal terms

### Types of diagrams
- Block diagram
	- Very abstracted diagram, allowing users to easily track and represent the components of the system/softare
- UML component diagram 
	- Lite more descript, showing more flow of information between components along with "subcomponents"
- SysML diagrams 
	- An extension of UML that is more focused on the design of a system instead of software as UML were
- Data flow diagram
	- Focuses on the movement of data across components

**Good software engineers care about data**, this is because data is the main thing that is worked with in software engineering, if
