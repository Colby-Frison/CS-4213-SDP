# Wednesday

**What is a problem that happens in normal life, and what is the solution:** 
	**Problem:** Health deficiencies stemming from a nutrient issue
	**Solution:** Taking a systemic approach to dieting in order to resolve the problem at hand, may it be as simple as a weight issue to as complicated as a health complication due to medical issues

==*Design patterns* are abstractions of proven design solutions to commonly encountered design problems.==

**What is the link between design patterns and our problem:**
	Bad dieting is the commonly encountered problem, and the solution diet is a pattern design from abstracting the problem.

**What is the most important thing discussed today:**
	 I feel like the most important thing is abstracting the problem in order to create the solution. In other words holistically understanding the problem.

	 **Understanding the pattern of the problem

# Friday

**What is a pattern:** 
	A problem that occurs in the same way multiple times

**Why design patterns:**
	Design patterns are solutions to known problems, these solutions are researched, and known to work very well. This allows software developers and their team to implement this solution without worry about its performance. This can also boost team moral, communication, and a lot of other subsidiary benefits.
