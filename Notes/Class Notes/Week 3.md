**Should you divide up the problem or find the solution first:**
	I feel you should first divide it, as if you first try to create a holistic solution you will miss details. To create a holistic solution you must abstract the problem to fully understand all details then assign responsibilities and create solutions for  each responsibilities to create the complete solution

**Grasp** = Principles and guidelines
**GoF** = How the guidelines are carried out


**What are the main parts of a design pattern specification:**
	A design specification is a recipe for creating and adhering to a design. It contains the general definitions of the pattern along with details about the patterns learned from their use.

- All GoF patterns

Here's the information formatted as a Markdown table:

| Pattern                     | Description                                                                                                                                             |
| :-------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |

| **Chain of Responsibility** | You want to process requests with request handlers but the exact handler to process a request is unknown in advance.                                    |

| **Composite**               | You want a representation and a uniform interface to process objects of classes that exhibit recursive, part-whole relationships.                       |
| **Decorator**               | You want to add functionalities to objects as well as removing them dynamically.                                                                        |
| **Facade**                  | You want to simplify the client interface to interact with a web of components.                                                                         |
| **Factory Method**          | You want to dynamically change the products created.                                                                                                    |
| **Flyweight**               | You want an economical way to create numerous occurrences of an object.                                                                                 |
| **Interpreter**             | You want to process rules that need to modify frequently and quickly on the fly.                                                                        |
| **Iterator**                | You want a traversal mechanism that hides the underlying data structure.                                                                                |

| **Observer**                | You want to decouple event handlers from an event source so that you can add or remove handlers dynamically.                                            |
| **Prototype**               | You want to reduce number of classes, reusing copies of an object to avoid object creation cost, or using a dynamically loaded class.                   |
| **Proxy**                   | You want remote access, delayed access, controlled access, or keeping track of accesses to an object.                                                   |

| **Template Method**         | You want to use different implementations of steps of a process or algorithm.                                                                           |
| ==**Visitor**==             | ==You want to decouple type-dependent operations from their respective classes (to achieve high cohesion and designing "stupid objects").==             |
