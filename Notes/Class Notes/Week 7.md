The transformation model is defined as a theoretical framework in software development that describes the process of starting from a formal specification of requirements and systematically transforming it into an implementation through a series of steps, often involving formal analysis and potentially automated transformations.

A **transformational system** is a type of information processing system with these key characteristics:
- **Core Function:** It's a network of activities that transform inputs into outputs.
- **Process:** The transformation is a mostly non-interactive, "batch-like" process with little to no user interaction during execution.
- **Key Traits:** It is typically **stateless** and often involves **computation-intensive** tasks (e.g., number crunching).
- **Control Flow:** Its internal network can be complex, featuring sequences, conditional branches, parallel threads, and synchronous or asynchronous behavior.
- **External Entities:** It can be triggered by a human user or another device.

3 main reasons for Activity modeling:
1. **Addresses a Unique Problem:** It models complex information processing workflows—including object flow, conditional branching, and synchronization between departments—that are not covered by Object Interaction Modeling (OIM) or Object State Modeling (OSM).
2. **Aids Understanding and Communication:** It provides a visual tool (like a UML activity diagram) that helps development teams understand, design, and communicate ideas about information processing activities and their relationships.
3. **Refines Requirements and Identifies Use Cases:** It is useful for refining high-level requirements and for identifying individual use cases by illustrating the workflow and control flow relationships between them.
   
System best suited for activity modeling are physical systems - systems, with many interactive components transferring data
