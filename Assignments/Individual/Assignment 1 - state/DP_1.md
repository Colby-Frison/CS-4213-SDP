# Assignment 1: State  
**Time Estimate:** 9 Hours  
**Due:** End of Week 7  
**Course:** Design Patterns  
**Chapters Covered:**  
- 3.4, 3.5, 10.1, 10.2, 10.3, 10.4, 10.5, and 10.6

## INSTRUCTION

This assignment is designed to provide a foundational understanding of software architecture and design patterns. You will review architectural principles, explore early-stage system structuring, and apply relevant patterns through diagramming and analysis. This is an **individual assignment** that builds foundational thinking for future implementation work.

## TASK

### a. System Architecture Breakdown (2 hours)  
- Read Chapters 3.4 and 3.5.  
- Choose a familiar software system (e.g., online bookstore, ride-sharing app).  
- Briefly describe:  
  - The system's overall **architecture** (e.g., layered, client-server)  
  - At least **three subsystems** and their responsibilities  
  - How those subsystems interact with each other  
- Include a **basic block diagram** showing these subsystems and relationships

### b. Design Pattern Exploration (2.5 hours)  
- Read Chapters 10.1–10.6.  
- Summarize the **Controller** and **Expert** patterns in your own words (150–200 words each).  
- Give one real-world example (not from the book) where each pattern could be used.

### c. UML Diagramming (3.5 hours)  
- Create the following diagrams for the system you selected:  
  - Use Case Diagram with at least 3 actors/use cases  
  - Class Diagram showing how Controller or Expert pattern could apply  
  - Activity Diagram for one core workflow  
- Use any UML tool such as draw.io or Lucidchart  
- Label relevant classes or methods where patterns are applied

### d. Pattern Application Reflection (1 hour)  
- Reflect on how using these patterns improves your system design  
- Answer:  
  - What problem did each pattern help you solve?  
  - How would this help in a large team or evolving codebase?
