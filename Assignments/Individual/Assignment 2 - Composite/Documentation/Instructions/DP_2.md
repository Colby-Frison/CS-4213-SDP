## INSTRUCTION

This assignment builds on your architectural modeling and pattern design skills, focusing on the **Composite Pattern** and its application in hierarchical systems. You'll also incorporate a relevant **object creation pattern** and demonstrate understanding of pattern-based decision modeling using activity and decision diagrams. This is an **individual assignment** that emphasizes both design accuracy and thoughtful reflection.

---

## TASK

### a. Hierarchical System Context (2 hours)

- Choose a domain where hierarchical relationships are inherent (e.g., UI layout, file explorer, organization tree).  
- Describe:  
  - A feature or module where multiple layers interact (e.g., nested UI panels)  
  - The uniform operations needed across levels (e.g., `draw()`, `count()`, `evaluate()`)  
- Provide a labeled **block diagram** or outline of the hierarchy

---

### b. Design + Modeling (3 hours)

- Apply the Composite Pattern in a proposed class-based design:  
  - Define Component, Leaf, and Composite roles  
  - Use consistent methods across elements (e.g., `print()`, `calculate()`)  
  - Add a supporting creation pattern (Factory, Builder, or Template)  
- Model logic in two ways:  
  - Create a UML Class Diagram for your Composite implementation  
  - Draw an Activity Diagram or Decision Tree to show a workflow tied to this component

---

### c. Pattern Specification + Interpreter (2.5 hours)

- Create a Decision Table based on one operation (e.g., `evaluate()` rules, permission checking)  
- Briefly outline how this logic could be encoded using the Interpreter Pattern  
- Add a few example rules as expressions or pseudocode (max ½ page)

---

### d. Reflection (1.5 hours)

- Submit a 1-page article that addresses:  
  - Why Composite fits your design’s structure and complexity  
  - The advantage of your chosen creation pattern  
  - How pattern-based logic models (Interpreter, Decision Tables) improve maintainability
