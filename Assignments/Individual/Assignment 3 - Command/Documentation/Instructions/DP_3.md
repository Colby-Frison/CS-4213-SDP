## INSTRUCTION

This assignment focuses on applying Model-View-Controller (MVC) principles and improving an existing design through structured refactoring. You will analyze system components, separate concerns, and propose practical changes to increase maintainability.

---

## TASK

### a. MVC Design (3 hours)

- Choose a simple system (e.g., to-do app, calculator, game menu).  
- Define the **Model, View**, and **Controller** components.  
- Create:  
  - A **UML Class Diagram** with MVC components labeled.  
  - A **Sequence Diagram** showing a complete user interaction.

---

### b. Refactoring Plan (3 hours)

- Assume that the system is currently tightly coupled.  
- Identify 3 areas for refactoring:  
  - One for flexibility (e.g., use interfaces).  
  - One for reuse (e.g., extract method / class).  
  - One for testability (e.g., decoupling logic from UI).  
- For each:  
  - Describe the problem.  
  - State the refactoring (name it).  
  - Provide updated UML snippet (if applicable).

---

### c. Tool Use + Reflection (2 hours)

- Research and explain how one tool (e.g., IntelliJ, Eclipse) helps with refactoring.  
- Reflect:  
  - Which refactor would have the biggest impact?  
  - How would these changes affect future development?
